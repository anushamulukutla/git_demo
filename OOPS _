what is oops
Object Oriented Language
In OOPs is to design the program using classes and objects .here the object is related to real world entites like book
pencil ,person etc anything is considered as object
Object manily   have two things
1.attributes
2.behaviour

-----Attributes:------
here attributes we can imagine them as data or  properties
we use variables to store the data. i.e attributes
lets consider an example
if a person is abject his attributes are
height of the person
age of the person
name
company work for
------behaviour-------
->Action defines our behaviour
talking
walikng
writing
standing all these comes under behaviour
to define the behaviour we use methods
oh what are methods , yeah we know functions right so in object oriented programming methods are functions
____>>>>>
in oops we have many concepts
like
objects
classes
abstraction
polymorphisam
inheritance
encapsulation

-------------------
In OOPS we always use classes and objects together
 why do we use classes and object together ????
---->
class is a collecction of objects
class is a logical entity that has attributes and methods
lets conside an example
lets take phone i.e iphone here iphone is designed by apple in us
and it is manufactured in china .. even though it is manufactured in china it doesnt mean this is a china phone
it is an apple phone
because the actual design is designed once and using it multiple time
so we can say class - design{we can also call them as blueprint}
so here based on the design -that mean class we create object (here objects are real stuff that mean entityzinstance
object ---> it is an instance of a class
which hass attributes and behaviour
here attributes are --->variables
behaviour are methods:



----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview of class and objecct :
 how to define  a class
 class class_name:
    '''This is a docstring. I have created a new class'''
    <statement 1>
    <statement 2>
    .
    .
    <statement N>
here statment is attributte or methods

what is a object :
object is an instancec of a class
it isa collection of attributes and behaviour
here attributes are variables
and behaviour are methods
We use the object of a class to perform actions
Attributes represent its state, and methods represent its behavior. Using its methods, we can modify its state
Identity: Every object must be uniquely identified.
State: An object has an attribute that represents a state of an object,
and it also reflects the property of an object.
Behavior: An object has methods that represent its behavior.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lets see a example of classes and objects
A real-life example of class and objects.

Class: Person

State: Name, Sex, Profession
Behavior: Working, Study
Using the above class, we can create multiple objects that depict different states and behavior.

Object 1: Jessa

State:
Name: Jessa
Sex: Female
Profession: Software Engineer
Behavior:
Working: She is working as a software developer at ABC Company
Study: She studies 2 hours a day
Object 2: Jon

State:
Name: Jon
Sex: Male
Profession: Doctor
Behavior:
Working: He is working as a doctor
Study: He studies 5 hours a day
-----------------------------
class attributes
instancce variables

The instance variables are attributes attached to an instance of a class.
 We define instance variables in the constructor ( the __init__() method of a class)


class variables:
ass variable is a variable that is declared inside of class,
but outside of any instance method or __init__() method.
